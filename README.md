# Graphical-Terminal-Environment
Final Project for Comp Sci A, (written in Java), replicates a visual 3-Dimensional controllable environment the user can interact with, all within the contents of your terminal.
	- No long being worked on, as of Jun 7, 2023

# Expectations
-Attempt to recreate a simple 2D graph
-Use this to recreate the illusion of 3D (plot lines to make fake 3D)
-Visuals are composed of ASCII characters
-Written in Java, only utilizes the terminal/console as a graphics environment / display

# Reality
-Ran into a lot of problems
-Recreated a 4 quadrant graph
-Due to limited amount of characters on a screen, can’t fit enough detail / ran out of time
Graphing ‘works’, still unfinished :( 
-Project was designed to have a scalable resolution (can change size of hypothetical graph)
-Works a lot lot better in higher ‘resolutions’ (ex. 300 by 300 will work better than 30 by 30)
